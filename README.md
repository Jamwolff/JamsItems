A bunch of custom items i created, some of these ideas may have already been invented (One that was for sure is the LJ-429) but i just wanted to add some interesting items.
Some 'borrowed' code and a LOT of help comes from Snivy Films
And some 'borrowed' code from Joker119- the LJ-429 is a remix of the LJ-119 by Joker119 in the CustomItems plugin, a broken part of the plugin, that I decided to fix and put my own spin on (Changes were made) which is allowed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 License that was originally filed by Joker119 \n
Made for SCP:SL as an Exiled plugin \n
List of Custom items: \n
\n -LJ-429 remade version of LJ-119 item that does NOT intend to stop 096's enrage, its just a tool to die on command
\n -Drugs, just straight up drugs, decently rare and gives a bunch of buffs for awhile followed by a bunch of debuffs
\n -Weird Quarter, Very rare coin that has a 50% chance to explode, and 50% to give one of three sets of buffs or a set of mildly inconvenient debuffs

\n Please give me any suggestions, inform me of bugs, and go a little easy, this is the second plugin I have ever made and so if the code is grossly inefficent or an absolute mess don't be surprised, it gets the job done, ok?
